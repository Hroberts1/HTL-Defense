# HTL-Defense System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The HTL-Defense project is designed to provide a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that integrates various components for threat detection, analysis, and response. This document outlines the system architecture, including the key components, their interactions, and the technologies used.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture of HTL-Defense is divided into several key components:

1. **Backend**
   - **Agent**: A lightweight endpoint agent developed in C/C++ that runs on client machines to monitor and report suspicious activities.
   - **Server**: The central server developed in Go that handles threat analysis, data aggregation, and communication with agents. It exposes REST/gRPC APIs for interaction with the frontend and other services.

2. **Frontend**
   - A web-based dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. It provides a user interface for monitoring threats, managing agents, and viewing reports.

3. **Threat Intelligence**
   - This component integrates various threat feeds and maintains a database of signatures and heuristics for detection. It is responsible for updating the detection rules and patterns used by the backend.

4. **Deployment**
   - The deployment architecture includes configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible to facilitate easy deployment and scaling of the application.

## Component Interaction
- The **Agent** communicates with the **Server** to send alerts and receive updates on detection rules.
- The **Server** processes incoming data from agents, performs threat analysis, and stores results in a database.
- The **Frontend** interacts with the **Server** through APIs to display real-time data and allow user interactions.
- The **Threat Intelligence** component continuously updates the detection rules used by the **Server** based on the latest threat feeds.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Go for the server, C/C++ for the agent.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Database**: A suitable database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing threat data and user information.
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing the application, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Ansible for automation.

## Conclusion
The HTL-Defense architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient, allowing for easy integration of new features and components as the cybersecurity landscape evolves. This overview serves as a foundation for understanding the system's design and implementation.
